# R-shiny-Dashboards

R Shiny combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. I have worked on two projects so far in R shiny, as shown below. 

## [Covid-19 Australia](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/covid-19-dashboard)

  - This is personal project aimed at visualising the covid-19 cases in Australia. It is an ongoing project and would probably feature an analysis on the economic impact of covid on Australia.
